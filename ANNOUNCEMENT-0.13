Hello everyone out there!

Time for the thirteenth release of the Free Gerber Viewer, aka gerbv,
the "good-luck-charm" release.

It wasn't long time ago I made a release. This is a minor bugfix release.
The bugs squashed are:
* You cannot compile with backend anymore, switch is removed. In last 
  release this caused compilation error due to bit rot.
* Drawing of arcs is a constant headache. Mark Whitis found another
  case that I had missed out. Clockwise arcs all of a sudden started
  to be drawn as counter-clockwise.
* Arcs with very small angle differences could either be a complete
  circle or a very small part of an arc. Calculating the angles with 
  integers wasn't sufficient, anyhow. They are now doubles all the way.
* Aperture macro primitive 1 was a _filled_ circle.
* Image rotate used to cause warnings that it wasn't implemented. Now 
  if the file has an image rotate on zero degrees there is no warning
  (yes I've seen it).
* Dan McMahill discovered that if you tried to swap with an unused layer
  gerbv segfaulted.
* Peter Monta submitted patch for incremental coordinates.
* No traces of Guile left...

Thanks to all patchers and error reporters.

Comments, patches and suggestions are, as always, very welcome. We use 
the bug database and feature request database available through sourceforge. 
Have a look there if you curious what's going on or if you have any idea 
that you think should be implemented in gerbv.

Homepage for gerbv is still http://gerbv.sourceforge.net/ where a bug database,
a feature request database, the CVS and a commit mailinglist is available.
