Hello!

This is to announce the release of gerbv-2.0.0!  Gerbv is an open source
Gerber file (RS-274X only) viewer for Linux and other unix flavors.  Besides
viewing Gerbers, you may also view Excellon drill files as well as XYRS
(pick-place) files.  For more information, browse to gerbv's web site: 

http://gerbv.sourceforge.net/

Gerbv is allied with the gEDA Project, an open-source collaborative
which has produced an end-to-end tool chain for PCB design on Linux and
other unices.  The gEDA Project's website is here:

Gerbv release 2.0.0 represents a a whole new look for gerbv.  Most
importantly, the layer control GUI has been made much more powerful through
the outstanding work of Julian Lamb.  Julian has also re-worked the GUI's
button and menus to make them more  convenient to use.  We are certain that
you  will find gerbv-2.0.0 even easier to use than before because of Julian's
amazing work! 

Other changes include: 

* Julian Lamb incorporated the cairo graphics library into gerbv,
  thereby enabling export to a variety of different output file
  formats, including PDF, PS, SVG, and PNG.  
  (GDK rendering remains available as a configure option for
  older Linux systems.)
* Cairo rendering also supports "transparency mode", showing you
  which layers are underneath other layers.
* Drill parser rewrite by Joerg Wunsch giving better support for
  internationalization and formats.
* Added report windows showing statistics of Gerber and 
  drill codes used (as well as CAM errors) by Stuart Brorson.
* Parser improvements from Stefan Petersen and Julian Lamb.
* Aperture handling improvements from Stefan Petersen.
* A new unit test suite (and nightly test runs) by Dan McMahill.
* Improved autodetection of file-type by Stuart Brorson.
* Improvements in the graphical rendering of pick-and-place files.
* Export of images from the command line (cairo only).
* Complete implementation of the Gerber spec.
* Open multiple layers at once in File->Open dialog.

Gerbv's homepage is on SourceForge:
