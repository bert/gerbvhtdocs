Hello!

This is to announce the release of gerbv-2.3.0!  Gerbv is an open source
Gerber file (RS-274X only) viewer for Linux and other unix flavors.  Besides
viewing Gerbers, you may also view Excellon drill files as well as XYRS
(pick-place) files.  For more information, browse to gerbv's web site: 

http://gerbv.gpleda.org/

Gerbv is allied with the gEDA Project, an open-source collaborative
which has produced an end-to-end tool chain for PCB design on Linux and
other unices.  The gEDA Project's website is here:

http://gpleda.org/

---- NOTICE ----
As of 12:th of June 2009, gerbv is hosted on the same location as the
rest of the gpleda projects. That means:
* Location of homepage of gerbv is now http://gerbv.gpleda.org/ 
  (please change your bookmarks)
* Source of gerbv project is now under git on http://git.gpleda.org/

The gerbv team will thank Ales Hvezda for making the transistion of the
web site and the source code a smooth ride.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerbv release 2.3.0 introduces mostly major bug fixes:

* Fixed a minor arc rendering bug in fast mode.

* Make the svg/pdf/ps export use a 1:1 scale instead of scaling to fit
  the page.

* Always require cairo now since we make use of some of the transformation
  functions even when using gdk rendering.

* Fix a bug in the vertical scrollbar calculations.

* Fix a bug where apertures < 10 were potentially ignored in
  some drill files.

* Fix clipping bug when viewing files with image offsets.

* Fix a bug where clicking on the message tab caused the keyboard 
  accelerators stop working.

* Improve the macro parser.

* Allow 0 degree rotation

* Fix some drill parser bugs element.

* Fix some additional Excellon export bugs.

* Fix the pkgconfig file to include some needed dependencies.

* Includes a "layer transformation" dialog window and functionality.  
  Right clicking on a layer in the sidebar and selecting the "modify 
  layer orientation" menu item brings up a dialog box which allows the 
  user to translate/scale/rotate/mirror the layer.  When re-saving the 
  layer, all user transformations are saved with the RS-274X file.
