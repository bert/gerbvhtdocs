Greetings friends,

it's time for the next release of Gerber Viewer, aka gerbv, 
the "now-it-installs"-release.

No news regarding bugs etc, this release is only to announce
that the complete build system is in place. To see more exact
what has been done, see 'What's new in 0.0.2' below. Next step 
will be to remove the most nagging things, like draw multi 
quadrant arcs, send along the filename of the parsed file to 
the Scheme backend and other small things before starting to
add things.

Homepage for gerbv is still http://gerbv.sourceforge.net/

To download gerbv goto 
	http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gerbv/
and grab gerbv-0.0.2.tar.gz

To install the program do
1. gzip -dc gerbv-0.0.2.tar.gz | tar xf -
2. cd gerbv-0.0.2
3. ./configure
4. make install

Interesting configure options are:
--help          : Lists all options
--disable-batch : Disable compilation of Guile/Scheme backends
--prefix=<dir>  : Install from dir <prefix>


What's new in 0.0.2

- Automake in use, so now the build system is "complete"
  - make install, make uninstall etc works
  - gerbv --batch=<backend> now searches local directory, 
    $HOME/.gerbv/scheme and ${prefix}/share/gerbv/scheme until it finds
    a valid backend, ie gerb-<backend>.scm.
  - backends moved from src to scheme in tarball

- Version flag changed from -v to -V

- Fixed 64-bit build problems thanks to patches from Dan <mcmahill@mtl.mit.edu>
  He also fixed some other build problems.
