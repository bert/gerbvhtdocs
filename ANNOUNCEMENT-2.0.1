Hello!

This is to announce the release of gerbv-2.0.1!  Gerbv is an open source
Gerber file (RS-274X only) viewer for Linux and other unix flavors.  Besides
viewing Gerbers, you may also view Excellon drill files as well as XYRS
(pick-place) files.  For more information, browse to gerbv's web site: 

http://gerbv.sourceforge.net/

Gerbv is allied with the gEDA Project, an open-source collaborative
which has produced an end-to-end tool chain for PCB design on Linux and
other unices.  The gEDA Project's website is here:

http://geda.seul.org/

Gerbv release 2.0.1 is a bugfix release.  It fixes a couple of bugs discovered
in the 2.0.0 release.  A couple of new features were also added in preparation
for the 2.1.X releases.  Here is a list of changes:

* Fixed bug with #define DRAW_H.  This bug manifested itself on Mac OSX
  platforms, but in principle would also cause problems on other 
  architectures as well.
* Added ability to re-export Gerber files from the command line.
* Cleaned up the output from --help.
* Incorporated code to enable Windows builds.
* Program icons are hooked up for installation.

Gerbv's homepage is on SourceForge:

        http://gerbv.sourceforge.net/.

There you will find a bug database, a feature request database, the CVS repo
and a commit mailinglist.
