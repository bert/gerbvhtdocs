Hello fellows

it's time for the next release of Gerber Viewer, aka gerbv, 
the "drill file support"-release.

Last relase I promised drill file support. Now it's here.
By adding the drill file support I was forced to do some 
cleaning up of the code, so there are great many changes
since last relase. I want to thank my friend Andreas 
Andersson aka Pitch for the drill file support and ideas.

Some menu alternatives and speed keys changed with the 
addition of drill support. Especially to note; you have to
use -d|--drill= to define a drill file at the command line.
Default is Gerber file. More on that is in the man page.

I have changed how arcs are handled. Before I did a lot of 
calculations during (re)drawing of arcs. That has moved to 
the parsing stage now, which hopefully brings some increase
in speed when redrawing. Now multi quadrant arcs are also 
drawn, though it has been very little tested. Be carefull.

The arc calculation changes also meant that the API on the 
Scheme side of things changed, hopefully to the better.

If you have a mouse with a scroll wheel, you are now able to
zoom in and out with it. 

There are also some bugs removed and some bugs added. The 
biggest bug (pointed out by Dan Christian, thanks!) caused
random dots to be plotted out.

For next release I think I will do some more GUI hacks. Or
maybe Aperture Macro support. That is can of worm waiting 
to happen.

Comments, patches and suggestions are, as always, very welcome.
