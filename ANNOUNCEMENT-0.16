Bueono vistas!

It is time for one more of the more and more randomly releases of gerbv.
This is the sixteenth release of the Free Gerber Viewer, aka gerbv,
the "projects-r-us" release.

This time it's not so many bugs found, but a big bunch of features added.
Notably are:
* projects: you can save and load setups in what I call projects.
* GTK+ 2 support: Compiles under GTK+ 2 with the added benfit of
  `ldd gerbv|wc -l` now returns 24 instead of 14. ;-)
* Now you can invert a layer by the push of button. Basically.
* When gerber files were defined with omit trailing zeros, gerbv could 
  parse them very bad. Now it should work better.

Projects
If you load a bunch of files, sort them into a nice order and give them
nice colors, you can now save this setup and recall it at a later time.
The project file format is in Scheme and for this purpose I have incorporated
a Scheme interpreter called TinyScheme. The casual user shouldn't note
this but the advanced user can probably do cool stuff with it.

The project stuff is very untested and I actually don't know how people will
use it. Try it out and send me your suggestions for improvements. The main
question is how paths should be handled. How it is intended to work is 
described in the man page.

Why bring in a complete Scheme interpreter when all you need is a simple
resource file parser? Because I could. And I missed it since I threw
Guile out head over heels.

GTK+ 2 support
This was a necessary step for me, because when more and more distributions
switch over to gnome2/gtk2 I didn't want to be left behind. There are still
some quirks around this, so you have to enable it at configure time.

I have in one instance used GTK_ENABLE_BROKEN to get around stuff
deprecated in GTK+ 2 (see log.c).
Thanks to all patchers and error reporters.

If there is anyone out there wanting to hack and develop gerbv 
further, please step forward. 

This release has many new features so expect bugs. If you find anything,
please report them asap. There are currently a couple of known bugs (see
the buglist on gerbv sourceforge site), but I do this release anyhow. I 
get patches with respect to previous, and this version and previous starts 
to differ too much to be really good.

Homepage for gerbv is still http://gerbv.sourceforge.net/ where a bug database,
a feature request database, the CVS and a commit mailinglist is available.

To download gerbv goto 
        http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gerbv/
and grab gerbv-0.16.tar.gz

To install the program do
1. gzip -dc gerbv-0.16.tar.gz | tar xf -
2. cd gerbv-0.16
3. ./configure
4. make install

Interesting configure options are:
--help              : Lists all options
--disable-exportpng : Disable compilation of export of PNGs
--enable-gtk2       : Compile with GTK+ 2 instead of GTK+ 1
--prefix=<dir>      : Install from dir <prefix>
--with-maxfiles     : Set maximal number of files (default 20).
--enable-unit-mm    : Change default unit in status bar to mm from inch.
