Hello everybuddy!

Time for the fifteenth release of the Free Gerber Viewer,
aka gerbv, the "even-more-nonexisting-bugs-squashed" release.

It is kind of fun that different people discover the same bugs
at about the same time. This time I have received several 
bug reports for the same bug. The bugs this time is quite
severe and I amazed that they haven't been discovered before.

The bugs fixed are:
* A long outstanding bug was that if polygons had circular 
  outline it wouldn't be drawn as circular outline. I have 
  not considered this bug important since it was kind of 
  "theoretical" bug but added it to the bug database. 
  Now Simon Munton sent in a patch to fix this problem.
* Simon also had other problems with polygons that made them 
  look very strange. He also sent in a patch to solve that 
  problem. 
* Some Gerber generators seems to have started to relax some
  syntax and thus has started to write for instance G4 instead
  of G04. Peter Brueckner discovered that and sent in a patch
* One of the aperture macros (no 7, thermal ) was severly broken.
  I had forgotten all about it, but Drew Moore reminded me by 
  sending an example. I basically had to rewrite all of the 
  drawing routine for that macro.

Thanks to all patchers and error reporters.

If there is anyone out there wanting to hack and develop gerbv 
further, please step forward.

Homepage for gerbv is still http://gerbv.sourceforge.net/ where a bug database,
a feature request database, the CVS and a commit mailinglist is available.
