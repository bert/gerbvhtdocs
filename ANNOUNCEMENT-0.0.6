Hello people

it's time for the next release of Gerber Viewer, aka gerbv, 
the "all files at once"-release.

Last release I talked about either fixing GUI or aperture 
macros. It became GUI. The radio buttons on the side have
now changed to colored checkbuttons, which makes it possible
to turn on and off different layers. The color on the button 
reflects the color on the layer. I want to thank my friend 
Andreas Andersson aka Pitch for actual starting this snowball 
of changes it became.

To be able to see which file is loaded on which button I have
implemented tooltips. Hold the mouse marker over a button
and a tooltip will pop up, showing the filename.

Drill file support is now "embedded". The program now tries
to automagically determine wheter the file is a gerber- or
drillfile and parse according to this. The -d is hence 
removed from the command line. If you experience any problem
with this, please contact me or Pitch.

I have changed how panning is done. This gave a tremendous 
speed improvment. Now you can pan painless despite you have
turned on 19 layers with over 100.000 elements in it. The trick
is to just copy pixmaps and not redraw the whole image. Unfortunate
I still have to redraw the image when zooming, so that is still
slow.

Another speed improvments is parsing; by changing file IO I got
a speed increase in parsing by two to three times. If you have
small and few files you probably won't notice a difference.

The only new supported Gerber element is Polygon Area Fill.

You can now zoom in and out with middle button resp. middle button
plus shift.

There are also many bugs removed and some bugs added. The 
biggest support with ideas, great (in many ways) gerberfiles and 
bugreports is from Joachim Jansen. A big thanks to him.

For next release I think I shouldn't promise anything this time.
But with Christmas closing in you never know what pops up...

Comments, patches and suggestions are, as always, very welcome.

Homepage for gerbv is still http://gerbv.sourceforge.net/

To download gerbv goto 
	http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gerbv/
and grab gerbv-0.0.6.tar.gz

To install the program do
1. gzip -dc gerbv-0.0.6.tar.gz | tar xf -
2. cd gerbv-0.0.6
3. ./configure
4. make install

Interesting configure options are:
--help          : Lists all options
--disable-batch : Disable compilation of Guile/Scheme backends
--prefix=<dir>  : Install from dir <prefix>


What's new in 0.0.6
- Turn on and off explicit layers.
- Color on button reflect color on layer.
- Automatic detection of drill- or gerber file.
- Tooltips over buttons to reflect loaded filename.
- Handles Polygon Area Fill
- Major rehacking of file IO and pan code to significantly 
  increase speed.
- Autoscaling. Loaded gerber files are automagically scaled and
  panned to fit in window. Also possible to do with loaded files
  with Zoom/Fit meny option.
- configure.in enhancement to support package building in Red Hat.
  Thanks to Wojciech Kazubski for patch.
- bzero changed to memset, which hopefully is more POSIX (for portability).
- Loads of bugs squashed and hopefully fewer added.
