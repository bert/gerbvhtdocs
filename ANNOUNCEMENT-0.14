Greetings fellows!

Time for the fourteenth release of the Free Gerber Viewer, 
aka gerbv, the "I-feel-ashamed" release.

There are only minor bugfixes that has been around in the
cvs for long time. It's a bad sign when you get bugreports
on fixed problems.

The fixes are:
* Removal of the last inclusions of malloc.h after tips
  from Charles Lepple.
* Some patch that fixed a problem for Larry Dolittle that
  I wasn't able to reproduce.
* Error messages when running RS274D instead of 
  "crash-and-burn" (ie segfault).

The development of gerbv has come to a grinding halt since 
I have found other interesting things to do. If there is
anyone out there wanting to hack and develop gerbv further,
please step forward. For instance, one thing gerbv needs 
is porting to GTK 2.0.

Homepage for gerbv is still http://gerbv.sourceforge.net/ 
where a bug database, a feature request database, the CVS 
and a commit mailinglist is available.

To download gerbv goto 
        http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gerbv/
and grab gerbv-0.14.tar.gz

To install the program do
1. gzip -dc gerbv-0.14.tar.gz | tar xf -
2. cd gerbv-0.14
3. ./configure
4. make install

Interesting configure options are:
--help              : Lists all options
--disable-exportpng : Disable compilation of export of PNGs
--prefix=<dir>      : Install from dir <prefix>
--with-maxfiles     : Set maximal number of files (default 20).
--enable-unit-mm    : Change default unit in status bar to mm from inch.
