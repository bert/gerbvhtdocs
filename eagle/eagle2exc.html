<h1 align="center">How to generate drill files from Eagle that gerbv likes</h1>
<h3 align="center">By Daniel Dorau</h3>

Gerbv is basically able to read the Excellon files generated by 
<a href="http://www.cadsoft.de">Eagle</a>, but you have to make a few changes
to them however. Gerbv expects the Excellon files to begin with a header
defining the drill sizes used. Eagle's Excellon files are lacking these.
<h4>How does Eagle generate Excellon files?</h4>
<p> With Eagle's CAM processor you have the possibility to generate
Excellon files of your board. For this you have to supply a file
defining the drills available to the CAM processor. This file usually
has the suffix <tt>.drl</tt> and is called <i>Drill Rack</i> in Eagle
terms. It contains the drill sizes in the form </p>
<pre>T01  0.018in<br>T02  0.036in<br></pre>
and so on.

<p> Drill sizes may also be given in <i>mil</i> and <i>mm</i> while <i>in</i>
seems to be the default. This drill rack file may be given to you by your board
house. It can also be auto-generated by Eagle with <tt>drillcfg.ulp</tt>, in
which case simply all drill sizes used in your layout are written into a
drill rack file. Now when you create an Excellon file with the given
drill rack file, the CAM processor chooses which drill fits best for
each hole using the given tolerance values. The CAM processor then
outputs an Excellon file (default suffix <tt>.drd</tt>) and an
information file (default suffix <tt>.dri</tt>). Within the Excellon
file generated by Eagle there's no definition of the drill sizes used,
it just takes the drills given in the drill rack file. However you can
see in the <tt>.dri</tt> file which drills Eagle has chosen. </p>

<p> So what you need to do to load your Excellon file into gerbv is just
adding a proper header in front of your Excellon file defining the
drills used by Eagle. You simply have to convert Eagle's drill rack file
to a valid Excellon header and put it in front of the Excellon file generated
by Eagle, then gerbv will know about the drill sizes. I hacked a small 
<a href="http://gerbv.sourceforge.net/eagle/eagle2exc.pl">perl script</a>
which just does this and is called this way: </p>
<p> <tt> ./eagle2exc.pl &lt;Eagle </tt><i>drill rack file</i><tt>&gt;
&lt;Eagle Excellon file&gt; &lt;new Excellon file&gt; </tt></p>
<p>The new Excellon file contains the needed drill definition and can
be loaded into gerbv. That's all. Good luck!</p>
