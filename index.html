<h1>gerbv - A Free Gerber Viewer</h1>
</center>

  Gerber Viewer (gerbv) is a viewer for Gerber files. Gerber files
  are generated from PCB CAD system and sent to PCB manufacturers
  as basis for the manufacturing process. The standard supported
  by gerbv is 
  <a href="http://www.maniabarco.com/transdown/rs274xrevd_e.pdf">RS-274X</a>.
  The basic difference between RS-274D (the old standard) and RS-274X is 
  basically the addition of apertures in RS-274X. It might be possible to 
  make an RS-274X file out of an RS-274D file and an aperture list.
<p>
  gerbv also supports drill files. The format supported are known under
  names as NC-drill or Excellon. The format is a bit undefined and
  different EDA-vendors implement it different. But basically you need
  to have the tools definition in the file, then the parser is quite
  tolerant. The different holes are shown as dots in the (scaled) correct
  size.
<p>
  The different layers of the PCB are separated into different files. 
  gerbv can load all files at the same time and display them "on top 
  of each other". You can independently turn them on and off.

<a href="http://packages.debian.org/testing/electronics/gerbv.html">testing</a>
 and 
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/electronics/gerbv.html">unstable</a>(Thanks Hamish Moffatt).</li>
<li> Thanks to Wojciech Kazubski Red Hat packages of gerbv are available 
<a href="http://www.sp5pbe.waw.pl/~sp5smk/geda.html">here</a> .</li>
<li> NetBSD. It is <a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/pkgsrc/cad/gerbv/README.html">available</a> from the NetBSD ports tree (thanks Dan McMahill).</li>
<li> FreeBSD, in their <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/ports/cad.html">cad ports tree</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h3>System Requirements</h3>

  gerbv is dependent on a couple of different external libraries:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK+</a>, the graphical toolkit (required).
<li><a href="http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/gdk-pixbuf/index.html">GDK-Pixbuf</a>, export of images (optional).
<li><a href="http://libpng.org/">libpng</a>, needed by GDK-Pixbuf to generate PNGs (optional).
<li>getopt_long from the GNU project. gerbv can do without getopt_long
    long options to the program will hence not be available (optional).
</ul>
Earlier gerbv was known to use Guile. Since release 0.0.9 this has been
removed. The batch feature and Guile support is removed.
<br>
gerbv is basically known to compile on all system which the above 
mentioned libraries compile on, basically all flavors of *ix. It
has been tested on:
<ul>
<li> Linux (2.2/2.4)
<li> NetBSD/i386 (1.4.1) (getopt_long not available)
<li> NetBSD/Alpha (1.5.1)
<li> Solaris (5.7 and 5.8) (getopt_long not available)
</ul>


<h3>Support</h3>
An attempt to gather information on different CAD-programs and how
to use them with gerbv:
<ul>
<li>Cadsoft's Eagle doesn't generate Excellon/drill files that gerbv likes.
    <a href="http://gerbv.sourceforge.net/eagle/eagle2exc.html">Here's</a>
    how to solve it with a Perl script.
</ul>


<h3>Why?</h3>

I saw quite many questions asking for a free viewer of Gerber files for *ix 
platforms. There are many available for the Windows platform, but apperently
not so many for *ix. I decided to write one. After some stumbling experiments
in Scheme, I rewrote it piece by piece to plain C. First version actually
generated PostScript.
<p>
So gerbv will never be targeted for Windows (at least not by me), the 
"competition" is too tough. If you want something for your Windows machine, go
search <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=free+gerber+viewer">google</a>
(since I don't want to make free advertisment for any particular brand).
<p>
Afterwards I have found some other free ones that works under *ix:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://gerber2eps.sourceforge.net/">Gerber2eps.</a>
   Generates Encapsulated PostScript from Gerber files.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.alphalink.com.au/~seychell/">gerb2tif.</a>
   Generated TIFF from Gerber files. Also includes a win32 binary for the interested.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.wizards.de/phil/java/rs274x.html">Gerber RS-274D/X file viewer in Java.</a> 
   Doesn't seem to work too well. Maybe a start if someone likes to hack Java.
<li><a href="http://www.swcp.com/~jchavez/gerber2pdf.html">gerber2pdf.</a>
  A Python script that converts a gerber file 2 pdf. Seems quite advanced.
<li><a href="http://gbtiler.sourceforge.net/">GBTiler.</a> Not actually a 
  viewer, but a panelizer as I understand it. Takes several gerber files
  and puts them together next to each other. Written in Perl.

</ul>


<h3>Is there going to be windows version?</h3>

Many of the questions I get is if there's going to be a windows version 
of gerbv. I personally have no machine available that runs windows and 
absolutely no idea on how windows work. About seven years ago I tried 
to install NT on a computer. It ended in disaster. I'll never try it again.
If someone steps up to take the initiative, I welcome patches to make it 
compile under windows too. Personally, I will never do it.
<p>
In the meantime, <a href="http://www.smtinfo.net/downloadframe.html">here</a>
is a listing of several free (as in free beer) programs for PCB layout on
windows.

<h3>Status</h3>
<ul>

<h4>What's there:</h4>
<ul>
<li> Parses (and draws of course) a lot of Gerbers, including aperture macros.
<li> Drill file support(NC drill/Excellon).
<li> Autodetection of Gerber-or-Excellonfile.
<li> Panning  and zooming (both stepwise and outline).
<li> Autoscale. Zoom and pan to fit window.
<li> Several files can be loaded and be shown "on top of each other".
<li> Different files has different colors.
<li> Explicit setting of color on layer.
<li> Explicit setting of color on background.
<li> Acknowledge layer polarity (paint/scratch/paint).
<li> A measurement tool so you can do measurement on the image.
<li> Export image to PNG.
<li> Possible to reload files which reloads all loaded files. Good when hacking
     Gerber files.
<li> Bugs that I want you to help us find. Since gerber is quite a 
     "open-for-your-own-interpretation" standard gerbv has a hard time catching
     up with all CAD-vendors interpretation.
</ul>

<h4>What is missing:</h4>
<ul>
<li> Complex layer operations, like knockout and step-and-repeat, are ignored.
<li> Proper documentation at all except a very good <a href="gerbv-man.html">man page</a>.
<li> Also have a look at gerbv's <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=409541&group_id=33921&func=browse">feature request database</a>.
<li> Surely other things I currently forgotten.
</ul>

</ul>

     The following (gerbv) switches are available to configure:
     <ul>
     <li><code>--disable-exportpng</code>: If you want to turn off export of PNGs 
     <li><code>--with-maxfiles=&lt;number&gt;</code>: Maximum number of simultaneously loaded files (default 20).
     <li><code>--enable-unit-mm</code>: If you want millimeter as default setting for measurement tool.
     </ul>
<li> Type <code>make</code>
<li> Type <code>make install</code>. Please note that if you want to
     install it in a system directory you have to <code>su</code> first.
<li> Test by typing <code>gerbv</code>
</ol>

<li> Run <code>cvs update</code> in the checked out gerbv directory to get the latest changes.
</ol>
</ul>


<h3>Submitting a patch or addition to gerbv</h3>
We are interested in all ideas and suggestions regarding gerbv. We also 
reserve us the right to reject them though. Ideas implemented in source
code always has a greater chance to make it into the release in a near 
future.
<p>
If you want to implement something for gerbv there is a certain "code
standard" we try to maintain. That is described in a text file in the
distribution HACKING. Please read it. And check that your code doesn't
stand out too much from the rest regarding naming of functions and
variables.
<p>
If you send in a patch <tt>diff</tt> is a very good tool. Before you
start hacking, make a copy of the original file:<br>
<tt>cp &lt;file&gt; &lt;file.orig&gt;</tt> for example like 
<tt>cp &lt;gerbv.c&gt; &lt;gerbv.c.orig&gt;</tt>.<br>

Then use diff as:<br>
<tt>diff -Naur &lt;file.orig&gt; &lt;file&gt; &gt; &lt;file.diff&gt;</tt><br>
and send us the diff file.
