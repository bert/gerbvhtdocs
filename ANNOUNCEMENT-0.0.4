Hello friends,

it's time for the next release of Gerber Viewer, aka gerbv, 
the "support broken EagleCad"-release.

It has come to my attention that Gerber files generated by
EagleCad are broken (from my point of view). I have added
some minor fixes for this. If you don't like these fixes
you are able to disable them, but they are in by default.
Just comment out the #define EAGLECAD_KLUDGE in gerber.h.

For next release I can almost promise drill file support 
too. I'm not doing the hacking, but I've seen some really
nice progress.

Comments, patches and suggestions are, as always, very welcome.

Homepage for gerbv is still http://gerbv.sourceforge.net/

To download gerbv goto 
	http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gerbv/
and grab gerbv-0.0.4.tar.gz

To install the program do
1. gzip -dc gerbv-0.0.4.tar.gz | tar xf -
2. cd gerbv-0.0.4
3. ./configure
4. make install

Interesting configure options are:
--help          : Lists all options
--disable-batch : Disable compilation of Guile/Scheme backends
--prefix=<dir>  : Install from dir <prefix>


What's new in 0.0.4
- Support for broken Gerbers generated by EagleCad.
- Minor reorganisation of source (split out drawing code).
- Some minor changes on how to calculate single quadrants.
