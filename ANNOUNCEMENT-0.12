Hello friends of gerbv (and all others too, of course)

Time for the twelfth release of the Free Gerber Viewer, aka gerbv,
the "not-as-stable" release.

There is about two and a half months ago since I made the last release.
The need for release has decreased since there are less and less 
severe bugs. And it has been both Christmas and New Year, so the family
life has had precedence over implementing new cool features.

What has been fixed then? The biggest visible change is probably the
"popup error window". It's all thanks to Dino Ghilardi who described
to me how GTK's logging works by sending me source code that I (ab)used.
Now gerbv is more of a true X application. 

There are still some quirks around this that I hope I get your help 
to resolve.Sometimes an error appears and the program quits so you 
don't have a chance to be able to see the error message in that split 
second it appears. Fix that I must.

If that happens you have a commandline switch so you can log all error
messages to a file. Put -l <logfile> or --log=<logfile>. It's of course
all described in the man page.

Then there is this improved millimeter handling. The only example I had
using millimeter was broken from my point of view so I ask you to use
it with caution and report all problems to me. Not as tested as I would
like to.

Daniel Dorau has written a short description on how to get Cadsoft's Eagle
to generate proper drill files. And a small Perl script to accompanion that.
It's available from the webpage and in the distribution under doc/eagle.

All layers on and off.

Then there are sleeve of bug fixes too including:
* Minor compiler warnings using GCC 3.x fixed.
* G55 implemented. Was actually found in an example in the "specification" .
* Building on MacOS X. 
* Some filled polygons could have problems and not being drawn properly.
* 64-bit compilation warnings fixed.
* Some (very few, only seen once by me) ccw arcs could be drawn cw.
* Plus signs in the coordinates of a drill file properly handled.

The man page is update to reflect all changes in the usage of gerbv.

Comments, patches and suggestions are, as always, very welcome. We use 
the bug database and feature request database available through sourceforge. 
Have a look there if you curious what's going on or if you have any idea 
that you think should be implemented in gerbv.

Homepage for gerbv is still http://gerbv.sourceforge.net/ where a bug database,
a feature request database, the CVS and a commit mailinglist is available.

To download gerbv goto 
        http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gerbv/
and grab gerbv-0.12.tar.gz

To install the program do
1. gzip -dc gerbv-0.12.tar.gz | tar xf -
2. cd gerbv-0.12
3. ./configure

Interesting configure options are:
--help              : Lists all options
--enable-batch      : Enable compilation of Guile/Scheme backends
--disable-exportpng : Disable compilation of export of PNGs
