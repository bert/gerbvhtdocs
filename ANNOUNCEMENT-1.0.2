Hello!

Godot has finally arrived...

This is to announce the third release in the stable branch of
gerbv, 1.0.2.

During the course of the 1.5 year many things has been rotting 
away in the CVS. Some patches has found it's way out on the 'net
anyhow, like the GCC4-patch.

If anyone is interested to take over this project and bring it up
to new heights - or at least maintain it properly - is welcome.
My interest and time for this project is not very high. So, anyone
out there, please step forward and contact me.

Anyhow, fixes includes:
* Removed all build support for GTK1.
* Dino Ghilardi fixed log.c (the last reminder of GTK1) so 
  log windows popup don't crash gerbv anymore.
* Dan McMahill added the GCC4 patch.
* Renamed stack_t to macro_stack_t to support darwin/MacOS X
  pointed out by Daniel Mack.
* Changed build system to suit new autoconf/automake versions.
  Caused gerbv not to find init.scm.
* Fixed a bug so gerbv can handle negative coordinates when using
  trailing zeroes.
* Better checking of return values for errors.
* Use setlocale explicit so your locale doesn't screw up sscanf 
  and strtod to use comma (,) instead of dot (.).
* For distributions there is a new directory called desktop, where
  gerbv.desktop and gerbv.png is stored for desktop settings.
  Submitted to Debian bug list from Vassilis Pandis for Ubuntu.

Homepage for gerbv is still http://gerbv.sourceforge.net/ where a bug database,
a feature request database, the CVS and a commit mailinglist is available.
