Greetings all,

it's time for the next release of Gerber Viewer, aka gerbv, 
the "aperture macros 'r' us"-release.

This time I have finally added support for aperture macros.
The aperture macros are converted to small programs in a
very simple "assembler". This "program" is currently executed 
everytime an aperture described with this macro is drawn. 
Therefore the speed of (re)drawing pages with many aperture 
macros can be slow. If you find the slowness tiresome then 
complain. I have a couple of ideas on speed improvements, but 
I have had correctness as main goal.

I have written a short description of the assembler in 
doc/aperturemacros.txt. There are some caveats though. 
Explicit X and Y and exposure given in aperture macros 
are currently ignored.

The RS-274X specification is not always very clear about these 
aperture macros. I have tried to verify them as well as I can 
(using the hand hacked page in examle/am-test/am-test.gbx), but 
it's not 'til it hits reallity it becomes most obviuous how it 
really should be. 

I do not guarantee any kind of correctness, even though I've
done my best. If you find any problem, please report back to 
me preferably with an example. There are some comments
in the file src/draw.c about question marks I've had. So if
you feel that you know anything about aperture macros, please
look in the code and send some comments to me.

Please note that the Scheme backend doesn't know anything
about macros as of yet.

Comments, patches and suggestions are, as always, very welcome.

Homepage for gerbv is still http://gerbv.sourceforge.net/

To download gerbv goto 
	http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gerbv/
and grab gerbv-0.0.7.tar.gz

To install the program do
1. gzip -dc gerbv-0.0.7.tar.gz | tar xf -
2. cd gerbv-0.0.7
3. ./configure
4. make install

Interesting configure options are:
--help          : Lists all options
--disable-batch : Disable compilation of Guile/Scheme backends
--prefix=<dir>  : Install from dir <prefix>


What's new in 0.0.7
- Aperture macros!
- Improved detection of drill- or gerber file.
