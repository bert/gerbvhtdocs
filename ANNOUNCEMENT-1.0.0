Hello!

Finally it is time for a stable release of gerbv. I have split out a
stable branch of gerbv and then consequently only made bug fixes on it.
On the head branch - which will be the unstable branch - there is a lot
of interesting work being done, mainly by Juergen Haas and Tomasz Motylewski.
So, this is the first release of the 1.0.x series, the stable branch.

Most of the fixes is chasing down segfault bugs and build environment
quirks. Noticeable are:
* trying to invert an unloaded layer caused segfault.
* when compiled with only short options, only the short options are listed.
* Negative and positive layers versus clear and dark settings. This
  is so weird it makes you yoddle. Anyhow, Richard Lightman spread some
  light on the issue and sent in a patch that made it work properly.
* Exposure flags on aperture macros revisited.
* Some minor build and segfault issues resolved.
* Holes in circles silently ignored before. 

Why stable and unstable?
Juergen Haas and Tomasz Motylewski stepped forward and wanted to add
pick-and-place file handling to gerbv. The differences between GTK+ 1.2
and GTK+ 2.* forced them to make a choice on one of the versions. 
Thus I decided in my great wisdom to branch of a stable branch to 
continue support for GTK+ 1.2. In the head branch (which thus is the 
unstable) GTK+ 1.2 support will slowly be killed off.

What does that mean to all features?
So all cool new features will be added to the unstable branch, while the
stable branch will continue to work just about the way it is today.

What is the naming convention of the branches?
I have decided to use the naming convention of stable-versus-unstable
release from Linux. Thus this is 1.0.0. The first unstable release will
be called 1.1.0. In the CVS repository the HEAD branch will thus be the
unstable branch and currently the stable branch has the tag 
STABLE_1_x_branch.

Homepage for gerbv is still http://gerbv.sourceforge.net/ where a bug database,
a feature request database, the CVS and a commit mailinglist is available.

To download gerbv goto 
        http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gerbv/
and grab gerbv-1.0.0.tar.gz

To install the program do
1. gzip -dc gerbv-1.0.0.tar.gz | tar xf -
2. cd gerbv-1.0.0
3. ./configure
4. make install

Interesting configure options are:
--help              : Lists all options
--disable-exportpng : Disable compilation of export of PNGs
--enable-gtk2       : Compile with GTK+ 2 instead of GTK+ 1
--prefix=<dir>      : Install from dir <prefix>
--with-maxfiles     : Set maximal number of files (default 20).
--enable-unit-mm    : Change default unit in status bar to mm from inch.
